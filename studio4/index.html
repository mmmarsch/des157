        <p> "As the Bulletin evolves from a newsletter into a magazine, the Clock appears on the cover for the first time.
           It symbolizes the urgency of the nuclear dangers that the magazine's founders--and the broader scientific community--
           are trying to convey to the public and political leaders around the world. " </p>

          <p> " The Soviet Union denies it, but in the fall, President Harry Truman tells the American public that the
            Soviets tested their first nuclear device, officially starting the arms race. "We do not advise Americans that doomsday is near and that they
            can expect atomic bombs to start falling on their heads a month or year from now," the Bulletin explains.
            "But we think they have reason to be deeply alarmed and to be prepared for grave decisions." " </p>

          <p> " After much debate, the United States decides to pursue the hydrogen bomb, a weapon far more powerful
         than any atomic bomb. In October 1952, the United States tests its first thermonuclear device, obliterating
         a Pacific Ocean islet in the process; nine months later, the Soviets test an H-bomb of their own. "The hands
        of the Clock of Doom have moved again," the Bulletin announces. "Only a few more swings of the pendulum, and,
        from Moscow to Chicago, atomic explosions will strike midnight for Western civilization." " </p>

          <p> " Political actions belie the tough talk of "massive retaliation." For the first time, the United States
     and Soviet Union appear eager to avoid direct confrontation in regional conflicts such as the 1956 Egyptian-Israeli dispute.
     Joint projects that build trust and constructive dialogue between third parties also quell diplomatic hostilities. Scientists initiate many of these measures, helping
      establish the International Geophysical Year, a series of coordinated, worldwide scientific observations, and the Pugwash Conferences, which allow Soviet and American scientists to interact." </p>

      <p> " After a decade of almost non-stop nuclear tests, the United States and Soviet Union sign the Partial Test Ban Treaty, which ends all atmospheric nuclear testing.
        While it does not outlaw underground testing, the treaty represents progress in at least slowing the arms race. It also signals awareness among the Soviets and
         United States that they need to work together to prevent nuclear annihilation." </p>

      <h3> IT IS 7 MINUTES TO MIDNIGHT </h3>
      <p> " Regional wars rage. U.S. involvement in Vietnam intensifies, India and Pakistan battle in 1965, and Israel and its Arab neighbors
         renew hostilities in 1967. Worse yet, France and China develop nuclear weapons to assert themselves as global players. "There is little reason to feel sanguine about the future
         of our society on the world scale," the Bulletin laments. "There is a mass revulsion against war, yes; but no sign of conscious intellectual leadership in a rebellion
         against the deadly heritage of international anarchy."" </p>

      <h3> IT IS 10 MINUTES TO MIDNIGHT</h3>
      <p> " Nearly all of the world's nations come together to sign the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. The deal is simple--
        the nuclear weapon states vow to help the treaty's non-nuclear weapon signatories develop nuclear power if they promise to forego producing nuclear weapons.
        The nuclear weapon states also pledge to abolish their own arsenals when political conditions allow for it. Although Israel, India,
         and Pakistan refuse to sign the treaty, the Bulletin is cautiously optimistic: "The great powers have made the first step.
         They must proceed without delay to the next one--the dismantling, gradually, of their own oversized military establishments." " </p>

      <p> " The United States and Soviet Union attempt to curb the race for nuclear superiority by signing the Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty (SALT)
         and the Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty. The two treaties force a nuclear parity of sorts. SALT limits the number of ballistic missile launchers

          <p> " South Asia gets the Bomb, as India tests its first nuclear device. And any gains in previous arms control agreements seem like a mirage.
      The United States and Soviet Union appear to be modernizing their nuclear forces, not reducing them.
       Thanks to the deployment of multiple independently targetable reentry vehicles (MIRV), both countries can now load their intercontinental

          <p> " Thirty-five years after the start of the nuclear age and after some promising disarmament gains, the United States and
      the Soviet Union still view nuclear weapons as an integral component of their national security. This stalled progress discourages
       the Bulletin: "[The Soviet Union and United States have] been behaving like what may best be described as 'nucleoholics'--drunks who continue

          <p> " The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan hardens the U.S. nuclear posture. Before he leaves office, President Jimmy Carter pulls the United States from the Olympic
       Games in Moscow and considers ways in which the United States could win a nuclear war. The rhetoric
       only intensifies with the election of Ronald Reagan as president. Reagan scraps any talk of arms control and proposes that the best way to end the

      <p> "  U.S.-Soviet relations reach their iciest point in decades. Dialogue between the two superpowers virtually stops.
         "Every channel of communications has been constricted or shut down; every form of contact has been attenuated or cut off.
         And arms control negotiations have been reduced to a species of propaganda," a concerned Bulletin informs readers.
         The United States seems to flout the few arms control agreements in place by seeking an expansive, space-based anti-ballistic missile capability,

            ban a whole category of nuclear weapons. The leadership shown by President Ronald Reagan and Soviet Premier Mikhail Gorbachev makes the treaty a reality,
            but public opposition to U.S. nuclear weapons in Western Europe inspires it. For years, such intermediate-range missiles had kept Western Europe

        <p> " As one Eastern European country after another (Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Romania) frees itself from Soviet control,
          Soviet General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev refuses to intervene, halting the ideological battle for Europe and significantly diminishing
          the risk of all-out nuclear war. In late 1989, the Berlin Wall falls, symbolically ending the Cold War. "Forty-four years after Winston Churchill's
          'Iron Curtain' speech, the myth of monolithic communism has been shattered for all to see," the Bulletin proclaims." </p>

          <p> " With the Cold War officially over, the United States and Russia begin making deep cuts to their nuclear arsenals.
     The Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty greatly reduces the number of strategic nuclear weapons deployed by the two former adversaries.
      Better still, a series of unilateral initiatives remove most of the intercontinental ballistic missiles
     and bombers in both countries from hair-trigger alert. "The illusion that tens of thousands of nuclear weapons are a guarantor of
     national security has been stripped away," the Bulletin declares." </p>

    <p> " Hopes for a large post-Cold War peace dividend and a renouncing of nuclear weapons fade. Particularly in the United States,
      hard-liners seem reluctant to soften their rhetoric or actions, as they claim that a resurgent Russia could provide as much of a threat as the Soviet Union.
      Such talk slows the rollback in global nuclear forces; more than 40,000 nuclear weapons remain worldwide. There is also concern that terrorists could exploit
      poorly secured nuclear facilities in the former Soviet Union." </p>

       located throughout the world. Meanwhile, the United States expresses a desire to design new nuclear weapons, with
