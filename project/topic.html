<h2> IDEA 1 </h2>

	<p>
Columbia is said to be the coffee capitol of the world, and I am passionate about coffee- so, it only makes sense to make a website that has to do with coffee! One idea I have is to make a website that would list coffee companies with the ethical labor practices and eco-friendly practices.
	</p>

<h2> IDEA 2 </h2>

	<p>
The other Idea I have revolving around the same topic, is a website that would be called “coffee break”. It would be a website that would revolve around the idea that people around the world take the time to drink coffee, and that this is a mutual shared time that is shared by many cultures and countries. This website could have articles that would be intended to be short enough for people to read while they are on their coffee break.
	</p>

<h2> IDEA 3 </h2>

	<p>
Going of the same idea of “coffee break”- instead of articles posted by a single person, it could be an interactive space for users to communicate.
