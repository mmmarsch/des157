<h2> Background Research </h2>

	<p>
  Coffee Break will be an app that will have daily updates with simple tips and info graphics that help the user to live a more ethical life style. This app will
require research regarding what tips and info graphics to use. I want the information to be short and sweet so that the user can get all the information they need within
the time of hypothetically drinking their coffee. I found a website that gives "19 easy and immediate ways you can life a more ethical life style”.  Of these tips some include
riding public transportation to lower your carbon footprint,  picking up trash when you walk outside, or going to a service for a religion you are not a part of. I found another
website that has an article dedicated to “ 14 genius ways to recycle used coffee grounds”. This includes tips like using coffee grounds as a pest repellent, as a fertilizer for plants,
or using it to exfoliate the skin. I think this website article is great because not only are the tips easy and fun but they also relate to the “coffee” theme. Going with the idea of
practicing more ethical coffee drinking, there is the idea of using reusable cups and coffee filters. Keurig and many other coffee companies sell a reusable coffee filter and starbucks
(as well as many other companies) sell reusable cups that make it easy and eco-friendly to get your latte in the morning without using a new plastic cup everyday. It might be interesting
to create an info-graphic of how many plastic cups and coffee filters are used in one year. Not only will I want there to be tips like these but I also will want there to be bits of
information regarding companies that practice ethical business. Recently, in the news it was said by Starbucks CEO that he plans to hire 10,000 refugees in the next year. I think information
like that would also be useful to provide.
