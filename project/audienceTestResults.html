<h1> Audience Test Results  </h1>


 <img src="person.jpg" alt="audience research">

 <p> The audience testing was very helpful and it confirmed most of the concerns
 that I had about the app. The first concern being that the audio button was to confusing to
 get to and was annoying to have to click every time the page loaded. To fix this issue I created
a custom play pause button using java script and css and it also helped improve the looks of my application.
I also made it so that the audio would auto play when the page was opened so that the pages blended more
seemlessly together. The other main concern was that the animations only moved when the page was first loaded,
and everyone thought the animations should continue to move around slightly. For this, I decided the best course of
action for the amount of time I had was to create GIF's out of the images, and only use animate.css for the text and
animations that only needed to run once. </p>
