       <p>

         In my most recent project I had to create a site that used input values to create a mad libs story. So, for this blog I will be analyzing a app that I use often that requires some sort of data entry.
         It was a little bit difficult to think of data entry uses on websites other than the simple login and password. I think that the app I use the most that has a more unique data entry form is Instagram.
         When posting a picture on Instagram you are given three fields of data entry- caption, tag people, and add location. It is very simple and to the point and allows for the user to have the option to
         not tag anyone or not put a location on their picture. I think this is a good example of an app that is very clean in design and straight forward- which I think is what should be used for forms on websites/apps.

        <h2> Blog 1- Thursday, January 12, 2017  </h2>
            <p>

            First blog enterance!<br>
            Today, I will be analyzing a interface that I use on a daily basis.
                The interface that I use the most would have to be YouTube.
                It has a quite simple design that I would describe as practical and
                User friendly. The set up of the YouTube homepage is quite traditional, in that it has a navigation bar on the left, a search bar at the top, the login on the top right, and the content in the remaining area. It seems as though they did not want to venture out to far into making a creative layout as to keep the
                navigation simple for the users. They also stuck to a relatively basic color scheme-black, red, white, and blue. I believe that this was a good choice because the videos that appear on the site have a wide range of colors, and so their color scheme does not compete with any of the videos. I think YouTubes strategy of keeping it simple is effective because the most important thing for their site is for the user to be able to navigate easily through the videos they want to watch.
