<h2> Topic Choice </h2>

	<p>
      For my project I have decided to fuse together my two ideas into one. The title of the project is going to be "Coffee Break"- an app that
      is similar to a blog in that it will be updated daily with content. The content will be one short and sweet tip or fact each day that the
      user can read and understand in the time that they drink their coffee in the morning, and will inform the user on how to practice more ethical habits.
      Some of the content will include facts about the coffee industry regarding which companies are the most eco-friendly etc.
